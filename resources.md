## Interviews
- Articles:
    - [100 Questions to Ask](https://medium.com/ux-power-tools/100-questions-designers-always-ask-8b9f441bcd35)

### Onsite Interviews

The hardest step of the interview process, but congrats you've made it thus far!
- Articles:
    - [Onsite UX Interviews | UXReactor](http://uxpamagazine.org/onsite-ux-interviews/): Satyam Kantamneni at UXReactor goes into depth on how to best prepare for the three-main steps most onsite interviews have.

## Tools

### Sketch App
- Plugins:
    - [Looper](http://www.sureskumar.com/looper/): duplicate, rotate and scale assets quickly.

## Front-End Development

### Online courses
A list of online courses that'll help you level up as a designer. Knowing code isn't always required but it definitely helps you understand technical constraints a bit better.
    - [Designers.how](https://designers.how): video tutorials teaching you techniques in tools such as Sketch, Origami, and Swift.
    - [Designcode.io](https://designcode.io): learn iOS 10 design and Xcode 8.

## Design Systems

It's always important to have a layout system in place to keep your designs consistent, especially across different viewing platforms.

### Grids
    - [8-pt Grid | Bryn Jackson](https://spec.fm/specifics/8-pt-grid): a dive into the way he constructs his workflow via an 8-pt grid system.

### Components
    - [Atomic Design | Brad Frost](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/): methodology for creating design systems; building blocks.

### Color
    - [Gradient Explorer - Brent Jackson](http://jxnblk.com/shade/)

### Company-specific Design Systems
    - [Material Design](https://material.io): Google's design system; includes guidelines, tools and resources.
    - [The Harmony Design System](http://harmony.intuit.com): Intuit's design system; unites all Intuit's products across devices and ecosystem.

## Inspiration

### Deep-dives Into Work
Portfolios that showcase projects with heavier content. Look to these if you want to see designers talk extensively about the process that went into their work.
- [Alan M. Shen](http://alanmshen.com): huge dives into each project; great process shown.
- [Julia Jensen](https://www.julianjensen.com): minimalist style, content-heavy structure.
- [Jesse Chase](http://jessecha.se): SF product designer, collection of work.

### Showcase
Typically you'll see mid-to-senior designers step away from heavy amounts of process. Instead, they'll just present numerous projects and companies they've worked on/for. Breadth vs. depth.
- [Sasha Greif](http://sachagreif.com): broad showcase of completed works + projects.
