# Design Resources
A curated list of design resources, especially for those up-and-coming to the industry.

## Motivation and Goals

Realized I could have been adding to a centralized list of dedicated resources towards improving myself as a designer here, vs. messaging myself links repeatedly on Messenger and only looking back on half of them.

This page is meant to provide anyone with a list of resources that *I've* found to be helpful, ranging from articles to Sketch plugins I use to help improve my workflow. I'm always open to feedback + suggestions, just let me know and I'll update the list if it's beneficial.
